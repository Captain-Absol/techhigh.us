Students who want to be part of a constantly growing field, full of opportunities, will benefit from the technical and hands-on training taught in our Electrical program.  Taught by leading industry instructors, students gain experience in residential wiring, commercial wiring, pipe bending, electric motor controls, data wiring, alarm systems, and electrical theory, as well as the use of essential electrical equipment. On the path to become a licensed electrician, students are exposed to the required entry level skills needed to gain employment as an electrician apprentice, and each student acquires classroom/work hours that will be required by the state for licensing. Students will be taught how to follow code regulations as well as commercial and industrial work standards, and by the end of this program students will be prepared for several career opportunities in the electrical industry. The Electrical program would also be a good choice for students planning to attend college for engineering (electrical, mechanical, civil, etc.) or majoring in construction management.
