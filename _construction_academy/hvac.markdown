Looking for a growing technology field with hands-on career opportunities? Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning & Refrigeration (HVAC&R) allows students to become skilled in the installation, service, & maintenance of heating and cooling systems in homes, schools, hospitals, and more.  Through lessons, laboratory projects, and live work on HVAC&R jobs at Worcester Tech, students learn to install and maintain places like residential homes, schools, hospitals, offices, restaurants, factories and more. With experience in electrical theory, the physics of heat and fluids, formulas for heat load calculations, as well as basic design and engineering of heating and cooling systems, it makes HVAC&R a perfect fit for students interested in the fields of applied science and math. Students will come out of this experience with vast knowledge of the trade that will lead to success as HVAC Technicians to Mechanical or Electrical Engineering careers!
