    <h1>Misconceptions on Vietnam</h1>
</header>

<p>The Vietnam war is sometimes referred to as the only war America has lost. However some argue that America didnâ€™t lose, as the domino theory was proved correct and communism did not spread to the southern Asian countries. Yet, southern Vietnam was still occupied by communists. Based on your experiences, which belief is more accurate?</p>
<p>Americans who opposed the war by protesting and insulting returning veterans, what would have you liked to have explained to them about the war?</p>
<p>Did your views on the war itself and/or the United States itself change at all throughout the duration of the war?</p>
<p>What advice would you give to someone considering joining the military today?</p>
