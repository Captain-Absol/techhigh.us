Students will have access to targeted vocational areas that provide optimal opportunities to acquire skills that will assist them with securing some type of employment. Students in the 9/10 VOC-P Program focus on functional academic skills, specifically geared towards MA Curriculum Frameworks and completion of MCAS Alt Portfolios. Students that participate in the VOC P Program do not receive a high school diploma or trade certificate. Students will receive a certificate of attainment after completing 4 years.

Students strengthen their money management, reading and writing comprehension skills as well as soft skills needed for success while on the job. Students will explore vocational areas that correspond to their skill development, interests, strengths and learning needs. Students in the 11/12 VOC-P Program continue to develop and refine skills related to money management and budgeting, independent living, employability and vocational areas. Students work on creating a resume while they learn the process of looking for and applying for job and volunteer opportunities. Students will have unique experiences and participate within the community contributing collaboratively while gaining invaluable experiences.
